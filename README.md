Title: "VoiceLearn: Bridging Literacy Divides with Multimodal Learning"

Problem Statement:
In the pursuit of quality education, a persistent challenge is ensuring inclusivity for individuals with varying literacy levels, especially among elder populations. Illiterate elders, in particular, face increased vulnerability to fraud and exploitation due to their limited ability to read written text. However, traditional literacy programs often fail to effectively address their needs, leaving them at risk and underserved.

Moreover, even literate individuals may encounter barriers to accessing educational content in their preferred languages or formats. This discrepancy in access further exacerbates social inequalities and hampers efforts toward sustainable development.

To address these pressing issues, we propose the development of "VoiceLearn," a comprehensive mobile application designed to empower users of all literacy levels with accessible and customizable learning resources. VoiceLearn offers a unique blend of visual and auditory learning modalities, enabling users to engage with educational content in a manner that best suits their abilities and preferences.

VoiceLearn allows users to capture images of text or audio inputs and then provides real-time translations and audio playback in their selected language. This multimodal approach ensures that both illiterate elders and literate individuals can benefit from the application's features, fostering a more inclusive learning environment for all users.

By leveraging technology to overcome literacy barriers and promote language diversity, VoiceLearn seeks to democratize access to education and empower individuals to make informed decisions, thereby contributing to the advancement of the Sustainable Development Goal related to quality education.
